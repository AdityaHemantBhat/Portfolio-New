# My Portfolio Website

Hey there! 👋 This is my personal portfolio website built with React and Tailwind CSS. I wanted to create something that actually represents who I am as a developer, not just another boring portfolio template.

## What's This About?

I'm Aditya, a frontend developer from Goa, India. After working with WordPress and Drupal for a while, I decided to build my own portfolio from scratch to showcase my work and skills. This site is basically my digital home on the web.

## The Stack

- **React 19** - Because I love component-based architecture
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Makes styling so much faster
- **Vite** - Lightning fast development server
- **Lucide React** - Clean, consistent icons

## What You'll Find Here

The site has everything you'd expect from a portfolio:

- About me section with my background
- My education and work experience
- Skills breakdown (both technical and tools I use)
- Project showcase with live demos
- Contact info and ways to reach me

## Cool Features I Added

### Smooth Animations

I spent way too much time getting the animations just right. Everything fades in, slides, and floats in a way that feels natural but not overdone.

### Work Modal

Instead of a boring grid, I created this sliding modal that showcases my projects. You can scroll through them horizontally on desktop or vertically on mobile.

### Contact Modal

Same idea for the contact section - it slides in from the left with all my contact details and social links.

### Responsive Design

Works great on everything from phones to ultrawide monitors. I tested it on my phone, tablet, and multiple desktop sizes.

### Fun Touches

- Hover effects on the "Let's Cook!" buttons (they have little smoke particles!)
- Background text animations
- Floating decorative elements
- Custom loading states

## Running It Locally

```bash
# Clone it
git clone https://github.com/AdityaHemantBhat/portfolio.git

# Install stuff
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` and you're good to go.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/          # All the React components
├── context/            # Portfolio data and state management
├── assets/             # Images and static files
└── index.css          # Global styles and animations
```

I kept it simple - no overcomplicated folder structure or unnecessary abstractions.

## The Data

Everything is managed through React Context, so updating my info, projects, or skills is just a matter of editing one file. No hardcoded data scattered everywhere.

## Deployment

Currently deployed on Vercel because it's dead simple for React apps. Just push to main and it auto-deploys.

## Things I Learned

Building this taught me a lot about:

- Advanced CSS animations and transitions
- React Context for state management
- Responsive design best practices
- Performance optimization for smooth animations
- Creating reusable component patterns

## Future Plans

- Add a blog section (maybe)
- Dark mode toggle
- More interactive elements
- Performance improvements
